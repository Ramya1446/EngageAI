## 🧠 Scoring Logic

Each lead is scored out of 100 based on:

- 💰 **Funding Stage** (Series A > Seed > Bootstrapped)  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Team Size** (larger teams = more scalable opps)  
- 🧬 **Industry Type** (AI, Fintech, Healthcare prioritized)

Scores map to:
- 🔥 **Hot Lead** = 80+
- 🌤️ **Warm Lead** = 50–79
- ❄️ **Cold Lead** = below 50

- 📡 **Best channel** (LinkedIn, Email, Cold Call)
